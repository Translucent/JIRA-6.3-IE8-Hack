JIRA-6.3-IE8-Hack
=================

This repository contains JavaScript-based hacks for JIRA 6.3.x, which makes many parts of it (fairly) usable with Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 (IE8). 

We've currently targeted making issue creation, viewing and editing work, along with workflow operations, issue actions, the Issue Navigator, and several parts of the standard Dashboard.

The hacks are deployed by inserting `<script>`-tags into your JIRA Announcement Banner, referencing one or more of the JavaScript files in this repository (see below for examples).

You may reference the files directly here on Github (recommended) or by downloading them and placing them within or near your own JIRA instance.

Warning!
--------
**The scripts and the functionality they provide should be carefully tested and used at your own risk. Translucent assumes no responsibility whatsoever for any problems or negative results - direct or indirect - that may arise from your use of the scripts.**

That being said, the hack has been developed for a customer of ours, who is thrilled with the results, so you should at least give it a try in a test environment. :-D

Examples
--------
To be described.
